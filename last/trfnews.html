		<b>2006-2007 Fund Development Club Goal Report Form -- PETS</b><br><br>
		

		The 2006-2007 Fund Development Club Goal Report Forms are now available for download on Rotary?s website in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.  The three-part Goal Report Forms were sent out to the District Governor-elects with the PETS II Supplemental Mailing.  Club president-elects should submit Club Goals to their District Governor-elects by 1 May 2006.   District Governor-elects should submit all Club Goals to the Foundation by 15 May 2006 for inclusion in the Worldwide Annual Programs Fund Goal announcement at the Convention in Malmo, Sweden in June 2006.  For more information, contact the Annual Giving Section <br><br> by e-mail:  EveryRotarianEveryYear@rotary.org;<br><br> by telephone at 1-847-866-3352; <br><br> by fax at 1-847-328-5260.<br><br>

		Rotary World Peace Fellowship Application Deadline Deadline for districts to submit 2007-09 Rotary World Peace Fellowship Applications is 1 July 2006. Clubs and Districts should be working to solicit new applications from qualified candidates NOW through April.  Club and district interviews should take place in May and June in order for Districts to submit their chosen applicant to Evanston by 1 July 2006. Thank you for helping us select outstanding Rotary World Peace Fellows in 2006.<br><br>  

		2006-07 Host Counselor Appointments Needed Scholarships staff are working to request host counselor appointments for the Ambassadorial Scholars and Rotary Grants for University Teachers recipients who will study during the 2006-07 Rotary year. Information on the scholars assigned to each district is being sent this month to District Governors-elect and Scholarship Subcommittee Chairpersons.  Each district must inform TRF of their host counselor assignments by 15 June 2006 (fax: 847-866-0934).<br><br>

		RRFCs can remind districts they work with that appointing committed Rotarians to this volunteer position ensures that Rotarians will guide the scholars in scheduling presentations at Rotary club meetings and working on Rotary service projects.  Without active Rotarian involvement in the stewardship of scholarship awards, it is difficult for scholars to fulfill their ambassadorial responsibilities and the scholarship becomes merely a funding source for study abroad.  Please help your districts to fulfill their role in training globally-minded future leaders.<br><br>

		For questions, please contact: Stephanie Veit, Scholarships Department Manager, tel: 847-866-3323; fax: 847-866-0934; e-mail:  Stephanie.Veit@rotary.org or visit our website at: <http://www.rotary.org/foundation/educational/amb_scho/seminars.html>.<br><br>

		<b>Scholarships Fund Pool for Low-Income Countries</b><br><br>

		All districts - both high and low-income - are encouraged to donate any amount of DDF to the fund pool as they plan their DDF spending for program year 2007-08.  All districts and non-districted clubs in low-income countries may submit one scholarship application to compete for up to 32 Ambassadorial Scholarships awarded annually through the fund pool.  All applications are considered on a world-competitive basis by a Trustee-appointed committee.  The deadline to submit applications is the same as for all 2007-08 Ambassadorial Scholarship applications: 1 October 2006.  Contact: Renée Stephenson, Resource Development Supervisor, tel: 847-866-3314; fax: 847-866-0934; email: Renee.Stephenson@rotary.org<br><br>

		<b>March Madness</b><br><br>

		Humanitarian Programs staff would like to bring your attention to the 31 March 2006 deadline for receipt of Matching Grant applications, District Simplified Grant requests and 3-H proposals. Each year March and April are the busiest months for the Humanitarian Grants Program staff. We expect to process 50% of all 2005-06 Matching Grant requests during these months in addition to the normal flow of correspondence, payment requests, etc.  As might be expected, our response time will be longer than normal during these months.  We thank you advance for your patience.We would like to request your assistance in communicating the following reminders and tips to clubs and districts in your zone.<br><br>

		<b>Reminders:</b><br><br>
		<ol>

		<li>New applications are entered into our system in the order they are received. <br><br>
		<li>Application acknowledgements and the corresponding file numbers are sent by email to the primary contacts, as listed in the application.<br><br> 
		<li>During March and April it may take 15 working days for us to acknowledge receipt of new applications so please be prepared for some delays.<br><br>
		</ol>
		<b>Tips:</b><br><br>
		<li>Send only one copy of the application to TRF. Sending multiple copies only increases the likelihood of double entry into our system, resulting in further delays.</b>
		<li>Keep a copy of the application for your records.<br><br>

		<li>Keep record of the date, by what method and to what address or fax number the application was sent.<br><br>
		<li>If after 15 working days the applicants have not received their file number in the form of an acknowledgment letter, confirmation of application receipt should be requested via email. <br><br>
		If sending the application by email, it should be sent to grants@rotary.org. For more efficient processing the subject line should say ?New request?, indicate the type of grant being requested and name the country where the project will take place. For example: New Matching Grant request ? Mexico? or ?New DSG request ? Canada?.<br><br>
		We thank you for your patience and assistance in spreading this message to clubs and districts in your region.<br><br>
